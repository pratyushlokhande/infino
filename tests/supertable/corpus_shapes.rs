//! The checked-in corpus tables, each written by a real published engine
//! release, must keep the format shape they were generated for and must
//! still open and rank under the current engine.
//!
//! The tables themselves are generated, not committed — a few megabytes of
//! fixture bytes that `tests/corpus/generate.sh` rebuilds from the pinned
//! generators. A checkout without them skips these tests with a note rather
//! than failing; set `INFINO_CORPUS_REQUIRED=1` (as CI should) to turn a
//! missing corpus into a failure instead of a silent pass.
//!
//! Two jobs, and the second is the less obvious one. The shape assertions
//! stop a regenerated corpus from silently drifting into a weaker shape —
//! a too-sparse corpus makes an old builder stamp a lower version, and a
//! too-small one leaves a structure the version implies with nothing in
//! it. The recall assertions pin the tokenization defect *in the negative*:
//! these terms are unreachable in every release that predates the
//! correction, and a reindex that re-analyzes is what makes them
//! reachable. Without them a reanalysis test would pass for the wrong
//! reason. The newest shape is the exception and is asserted the other
//! way round — it already holds the corrected terms, and is stale only
//! because it cannot say so.
//!
//! ## Why there is no V3 shape
//!
//! V3 is the pre-coarse blob with a position run-offset sub-index, and no
//! published release can write one. A blob is stamped V3 only when its
//! positions region has a body, and `FtsField::positions` first appears in
//! the public API at `0.8.1` — a release that writes V5. Every release in
//! the V3 window (`0.5.5`–`0.5.12`) constructs `positions: false` on every
//! catalog path, so its positional blobs do not exist.
//!
//! The same fact empties part of V4: a `0.5.12` file may carry bitset
//! blocks, but never a populated positions region or the sub-index that
//! rides with it. So the earliest positional shape reachable in the wild
//! is V5, which `v5_positional` covers.
//!
//! This is the V1 argument in a second place — a shape the reader still
//! accepts but nothing in the wild can be in — and it is what makes both
//! droppable together when the superseded read paths go.
