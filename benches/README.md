# infino benches

Infino's in-tree benchmarks measure Infino itself. Cross-engine comparison
benches live in `retrievalbench`; these tables are the Infino reference numbers
those comparisons are checked against.

All benchmarks run on Infino's custom bench harness (one binary, no external
bench framework). The harness owns the measured lifecycle directly:

- generate the corpus once;
- build the artifact once;
- run correctness on that built artifact;
- run warm reads on that artifact;
- upload or commit that same artifact for object-store tiers;
- run cold reads against the uploaded/committed artifact with fresh cache state;
- sample RSS around the measured phase;
- render terminal and markdown reports through `report.rs`.

The invariant is simple: **the first measured build produces the artifact used by
correctness, warm reads, and cold upload/commit.** The benchmark must not rebuild a
second copy just to run correctness or object-store reads.

## Bench Shapes

- **Superfile** — single-artifact, in-memory read path. Default scale: `1M`
  docs, controlled by `INFINO_BENCH_SUPERFILE_DOCS`.
- **Supertable** — multi-artifact table committed to object storage and read
  through warm/cold table paths. Default scale: `10M` docs, controlled by
  `INFINO_BENCH_SUPERTABLE_DOCS`.
- Doc counts are plain integers — `100K`/`1M` suffixes do not parse.
- **Writer count** — build rows report `1 writer` and `N writers`. `N` defaults
  to the machine's logical core count and is controlled by
  `INFINO_BENCH_WRITERS`.

## Invocation

Selection is positional tokens after `--`: `[tier] [modality] [phase ...]`,
space-separated. Tier is `superfile` | `supertable`; modality is `fts` |
`vector` | `sql`; phase is `build` | `warm` | `cold` (`search` = warm+cold).
Omitted tokens mean "all".

```sh
# Run every tier × modality test, all phases.
cargo bench

# Run one cell, all phases.
cargo bench -- superfile fts
cargo bench -- supertable vector

# One tier, all three modalities.
cargo bench -- supertable

# Select phases.
cargo bench -- superfile sql cold
cargo bench -- supertable vector build warm

# Smaller local loop (plain integer; K/M suffixes do not parse).
INFINO_BENCH_SUPERFILE_DOCS=100000 cargo bench -- superfile fts warm

# Override the N-writers build row.
INFINO_BENCH_WRITERS=4 cargo bench -- superfile fts build

# Refresh the markdown sections in this file.
INFINO_BENCH_UPDATE_README=1 cargo bench -- superfile fts

# Diagnostics (standalone programs in the same binary; never implied by
# `all` or a bare `cargo bench`).
cargo bench -- diagnostic                  # all five
cargo bench -- diagnostic scale tombstone  # a subset, grouped
cargo bench -- tombstone                   # bare names also work
# Names: scale | tombstone | update | sql-diag | object-store
```

## Object-store backends

The supertable benches (and the superfile cold tier) run against an object
store, chosen **explicitly** by `INFINO_BENCH_STORE` — never inferred from
which credentials happen to be set:

| `INFINO_BENCH_STORE` | Backend | Extra env |
|---|---|---|
| _unset_ / `s3s_fs` | in-process s3s-fs emulator | — |
| `s3` | real AWS S3 | `INFINO_REAL_S3_BUCKET` + the standard `AWS_*` credentials |
| `azure` | real Azure Blob | `INFINO_REAL_AZURE_CONTAINER` + `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` + `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` |

```sh
# Superfile cold tiers: any backend (s3s-fs is the zero-setup default).
cargo bench -- superfile fts cold

# Supertable tests: real object store only (s3 or azure). s3s-fs lacks the
# multi-commit If-Match CAS the supertable commit needs, so it is rejected.
INFINO_BENCH_STORE=s3 INFINO_REAL_S3_BUCKET=my-bucket \
  cargo bench -- supertable fts
INFINO_BENCH_STORE=azure INFINO_REAL_AZURE_CONTAINER=my-container \
  AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=... AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=... \
  cargo bench -- supertable sql cold
```

A real-backend run writes under a unique prefix and deletes it on exit; set
`INFINO_BENCH_KEEP_TABLE=1` to keep it (the prefix is logged). The s3s-fs
emulator self-cleans and reproduces request/byte volume, not network latency.

## Vector search tuning

The vector benches calibrate each recall target by sweeping a probe/refine
grid, then report a user-facing `default` row. Three knobs control that row
and let you skip the sweep:

- `INFINO_BENCH_VECTOR_NPROBE` — probe count for the `default` row (default 8).
- `INFINO_BENCH_VECTOR_RERANK` — rerank multiplier for the `default` row
  (default 20).
- `INFINO_BENCH_SKIP_CALIBRATION=1` — measure **only** the fixed
  `(nprobe, rerank)` `default` row: skips the correctness gate, the
  recall-target calibration sweep, and brute-force ground-truth generation.
  This is the fast path for a fixed-config **cold-only** latency number on a
  many-segment supertable, where sweeping the full grid over a cold table is
  prohibitively slow.
- `INFINO_BENCH_PREFETCH_CONCURRENCY` — disk-cache prefetch fan-out for the
  cold-fill / promotion path on many-segment tables (default 8).

```sh
# Fast fixed-config cold vector latency (no calibration sweep):
INFINO_BENCH_STORE=s3 INFINO_REAL_S3_BUCKET=my-bucket INFINO_BENCH_SKIP_CALIBRATION=1 \
  INFINO_BENCH_VECTOR_NPROBE=8 INFINO_BENCH_VECTOR_RERANK=4 cargo bench -- supertable vector cold
```

## Prepared datasets

The supertable corpus is fully seeded, so an ingested table is reusable.
`dataset` verbs split the run: **prepare** once (ingest to a fixed prefix and
write a `dataset.json` sidecar), then **bench** the read phases against it as
many times as needed — no corpus generation, no ingest. Real object store
only.

```sh
# Prepare a dataset (one sub-prefix per modality: <prefix>/{fts,vector,sql}).
INFINO_BENCH_STORE=azure INFINO_REAL_AZURE_CONTAINER=my-container \
  cargo bench -- dataset prepare datasets/bench-10m

# Benchmark an existing dataset (fails fast if it is not there).
cargo bench -- dataset bench datasets/bench-10m vector warm

# End-to-end: prepare if absent, then bench.
cargo bench -- dataset run datasets/bench-10m fts
```

The sidecar records the corpus/index knobs the dataset was built with; the
bench refuses to open a dataset whose knobs don't match its own config
(re-prepare instead). `INFINO_BENCH_SUPERTABLE_DOCS` must therefore match the
prepare-time count. The `Dataset bench (Azure)` workflow drives the same
verbs from CI.

## Test Matrix

The matrix is tier × modality — six cells:

| Selector | Tier | Modality |
|---|---|---|
| `superfile fts` | superfile | FTS |
| `superfile vector` | superfile | vector |
| `superfile sql` | superfile | SQL |
| `supertable fts` | supertable | FTS |
| `supertable vector` | supertable | vector |
| `supertable sql` | supertable | SQL |

Each cell supports `build`, `warm`, and `cold`. If no cell is selected, all
six run. If no phase is supplied, all three phases run.

## Code Layout (`infino-bench-utils`)

```text

executors.rs                shared build/search/query executors + emitters

rss.rs                      per-phase RSS sampling
tiers.rs                    object-store backend selection (s3s-fs / s3 / azure)
superfile.rs                superfile runners by modality (fts / vector / sql)
supertable.rs               supertable object-store runners by modality
ingest/, fixture/           supertable object-store helpers
scale.rs, sql_diag.rs       diagnostics (recall gates, SQL dispatch tax)
tombstone_overhead.rs       diagnostics (delete/tombstone query overhead)
supertable_update.rs        diagnostics (update/delete pipeline)
unified_object_store.rs     diagnostics (cold lazy-fetch request shape)
```

## Result Anchors

Each generated section is wrapped in
`<!-- BEGIN: bench/... --> <!-- END: bench/... -->` markers. When
`INFINO_BENCH_UPDATE_README=1` is set, the runners replace the matching
block in place. Cells render `value (delta)` against the previous run's
baseline (`target/infino-bench/<bench>.json`); `(new)` means no baseline
existed yet.

## Results

Current numbers: 1M docs per tier, real AWS S3 (us-east-1), recorded

Build path: `SuperfileBuilder` → unified `.parquet` (same as production supertable commit), through the engine-generic `run_fts` driver the cross-engine comparison also uses. Rows are by writer count: `1 writer` is the single-threaded build (and the index queries run against); `N writers` is the sharded parallel build. Bandwidth is over the logical input text payload. Δ is vs the previous run.

The headline comparison is the scan-vs-pushdown pairs: the *same* selective
equality (one matching row) run as a plain DataFusion scan vs through Infino's
token index (FTS-pushdown — the index selects the candidate rows, DataFusion
verifies). Same predicate, same result, so the gap is purely the index as an
access path.
