//! Lease primitives for the WAL pipeline.
//!
//! Cooperative ownership of one WAL by the process currently
//! driving it. The lease is **advisory** — the load-bearing safety
//! primitive is the etag CAS on the state doc; the lease only
//! prevents two processes from doing the same work concurrently
//! (still correct, just wasteful). Safety arguments of the form
//! "this is safe because we hold the lease" are wrong — every
//! state transition has to surface at the CAS layer.
//!
//! ## What lives here
//!
//! - [`try_acquire`] — vacant or expired → CAS-take. Vacant means
//!   the WAL's `lease` field is `None`; expired means `expires_at`
//!   is in the past relative to `now`. The CAS returns the new etag
//!   on success or a typed `LeaseConflict` on contention.
//! - [`try_heartbeat`] — owner extends the lease's `expires_at`.
//!   The caller passes the owner id it expects to still hold the
//!   lease; if the WAL's `lease.owner` no longer matches we surface
//!   [`LeaseError::Preempted`] so the caller's work thread can wind
//!   down without producing duplicate work.
//! - [`try_release`] — owner clears the lease on completion. Pure
//!   hygiene; not strictly required since the lease would expire
//!   naturally.
//!
//! ## Defaults
//!
//! [`DEFAULT_LEASE_DURATION`] is 60 s; [`DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`]
//! is 10 s. Tests override both to drive edge cases (a 100 ms lease
//! makes expiry observable in a single test run).
//!
//! Wall-clock times go through `chrono::Utc` so they round-trip
//! through the JSON state doc unchanged; the lease grants
//! `Duration` is converted at acquire / heartbeat time.

// task that periodically extends the lease's `expires_at`. The
// task self-terminates on:
//
//   - **Preemption** — heartbeat CAS surfaces a different owner
//     or no lease at all (LeaseMissing / Preempted).
//   - **Stuck worker** — the work thread hasn't called
//     `mark_progress()` in over `T_lease / 2`. The lease expires
//     so recovery can take over.
//   - **Explicit stop** — the work thread calls
//     `HeartbeatHandle::stop()` after a clean completion.
//
// The heartbeat task is *not* the safety primitive — CAS on
// state-doc PUTs is. The heartbeat keeps the lease fresh so peer
// recovery doesn't preempt prematurely; nothing more.

/// Tracker the work thread + the heartbeat task share. The work
/// thread bumps `last_progress_at_unix_ms` after each storage
