//! WAL state-document shape.
//!
//! Serialized as JSON, one object per WAL entry, at
//! `wal/mutations/<wal_id_hex>.json`. Every transition through
//! the update / delete state machine writes a fresh version of
//! this document under the same path via `put_if_match` (etag
//! CAS). The shape is intentionally flat and forward-compatible:
//! unknown JSON keys are tolerated on the read path so future
//! additions don't break older readers.
//!
//! ## Why JSON
//!
//! Three considerations:
//!
//! - The state doc is touched many times per WAL (once per
//!   tombstone outcome, plus the INTENT → APPENDED → COMPLETE
//!   transitions). Human-readable bytes make on-disk forensics
//!   from `s3 cp` / `cat *.json` trivial.
//! - Volume is bounded by a per-mutation cap on the target-list
//!   size, so even worst-case state docs sit in the
//!   single-digit-MB range — well within what JSON tolerates.
//! - The payload (Arrow IPC `new_rows`, for UPDATE) goes in a
//!   separate `.arrow` sidecar — the JSON state doc never carries
//!   megabytes of row data through its CAS rewrites.
