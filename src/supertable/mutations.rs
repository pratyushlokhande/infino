//! Public types + entry points for update / delete operations.
//!
//! Mutations follow the buffer + commit shape that `append()`
//! already uses:
//!
//! 1. `update()` / `delete()` resolve the predicate against the
//!    current manifest snapshot, capture the matching `_id` set,
//!    pre-reserve any resources the WAL will need (an `_id`
//!    range + a fresh superfile UUID for updates), and stash a
//!    pending entry on the writer.
//! 2. `commit()` flushes the buffered work atomically from the
//!    caller's perspective: pending appends are written first,
//!    then each buffered update drives its WAL pipeline through
//!    append + tombstone phases, then each buffered delete
//!    drives its tombstone phase.
//!
//! Durability is the commit barrier: a writer dropped without
//! `commit()` returning `Ok` discards every buffered entry. Same
//! shape as `append()`'s buffer.
//!
//! ## What's here
//!
//! - [`PendingUpdate`] / [`PendingDelete`] — values returned from
//!   the corresponding writer entry points. Carry `matched` so the
//!   caller can decide whether to proceed; the actual `OperationOutcome`
//!   surfaces on the next `commit()` call.
//! - [`CommitResult`] — aggregate returned from a successful
//!   `commit()`. Contains one [`OperationOutcome`] per buffered
//!   mutation, in buffer order.
//! - [`CommitError`] — typed failures from `commit()`, including
//!   `PartialCommit { committed_wal_ids, cause }` for the
//!   recoverable mid-flush case.
//! - [`MutationError`] — typed failures surfaced at
//!   `update()` / `delete()` call time (schema mismatch,
//!   cardinality, cap exceeded, storage).
