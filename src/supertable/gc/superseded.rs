//! The deferred sweep a commit schedules: delete exactly what committed manifests dropped.
//!
//! A commit uploads its files first and swaps the manifest pointer last, so until the swap lands
//! those files are in storage and in no committed manifest. A sweep that lists storage and deletes
//! what the committed manifest does not name cannot tell them from garbage, and a commit slower
//! than its grace loses its own files. This sweep never lists. Each commit records the keys its
//! base manifest referenced and its successor dropped; the sweep deletes those, one grace later:
//!
//! ```text
//!   commit lands ── note(base, new, removed) ──► the handle's pending keys
//!                                                    │  a scheduled sweep takes them all
//!                                                    ▼
//!                        sleep the grace (readers pinned to `base` finish their fetches)
//!                                                    │
//!                        re-read the pointer ── fails? ──► put the keys back for the next sweep
//!                                                    ▼
//!                        skip keys the latest manifest names ──► DELETE the rest
//! ```
//!
//! An upload whose commit has not landed is in no committed manifest, so no commit can have
//! recorded it, and this sweep cannot delete it. Objects no commit ever published (a failed or
//! crashed commit, keys lost with a process that died during the grace) are orphans for
//! [`Supertable::gc`](crate::Supertable::gc), whose listing sweep `optimize` runs with a one-day
//! grace.
