//! 128-bit Snowflake-style id generator for the supertable's
//! auto-injected `_id` column.
//!
//! Layout (most-significant-bit first):
//!
//! ```text
//! 127                              64 63              24 23      0
//! ┌────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────┐
//! │     64-bit ms timestamp        │   40 worker     │ 24 ctr  │
//! └────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! `next_id()` returns `i128`, matching the Arrow / Parquet
//! `Decimal128(38, 0)` storage type. The high bit (i128's
//! sign) stays 0 for any plausible lifetime — a 64-bit
//! Unix-ms timestamp exhausts in year ~292M — so signed
//! `i128` comparison matches time order, giving cheap
//! skip-pruning by id range at the manifest layer.
//!
//! The generator is single-threaded by construction
//! (ferroid's `BasicSnowflakeGenerator` is interior-mutable
//! via `Cell`, so it's `!Sync`). One generator per supertable
//! handle is the intended usage; the supertable's writer-slot
//! lock already serializes `append()` per handle, so no
//! cross-thread sharing is needed.
