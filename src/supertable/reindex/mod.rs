//! Planning which superfiles a migration has to rewrite.
//!
//! A reindex job is a **one-input** compaction job: the same seal, merge
//! and manifest swap a merge already performs, with a single superfile
//! going in and its rewritten replacement coming out. Reusing that path is
//! what makes a migration atomic per superfile and safe across processes
//! for free — the tombstone-sidecar seal is what serializes writers, and
//! it does not care how many inputs a job has.
//!
//! Compaction's own planner cannot be reused, and should not be changed to
//! allow it: it excludes superfiles already at target size, and requires
//! two inputs because merging one is a no-op *for compaction*. Both rules
//! stay true there. For a migration the rewrite is the entire point, and
//! the files it must reach are exactly the large, already-compacted ones
//! compaction skips — so the selection rule is different, and lives here.
