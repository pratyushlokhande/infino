//! Table-level term index: for every `(column, term)`, the superfiles that
//! contain it, with the term's `df` in each, an upper bound on the score it
//! can reach there, and where its postings sit in that superfile.
//!
//! One artifact answers three questions the manifest used to answer with
//! three structures — *which superfiles hold this term* (the per-part and
//! per-entry term blooms), *how often it occurs table-wide* (the term-stats
//! sidecar's `df` sums), and *where its postings are* (the dictionary
//! inlined into every manifest entry's open blob). Both blooms saturate on
//! a large table and prune nothing; the inlined dictionary was most of a
//! decoded manifest's bytes. This index replaces all three with something
//! that is looked into, not loaded.
//!
//! **Shape.** A small *root* stays resident: the covered superfiles (postings
//! name them by ordinal) and, per segment, the key range and content hash of
//! every *slice*. A slice is one contiguous range of `column \x1F term` keys,
//! a few MB, holding a front-coded block dictionary (`utils::terms`) over a
//! postings region; a lookup binary-searches the root for the one slice that
//! can hold the key, fetches it, and reads one block. Prefix scans touch one
//! slice or a few adjacent ones. See `format` for the byte layout.
//!
//! **Validity.** A posting is followed only if its superfile is live in the
//! current manifest; postings for removed superfiles are simply ignored. So
//! a removal never invalidates the artifact — unlike the term-stats sidecar,
//! whose *sums* could not be attributed back to a departed superfile — and
//! the reference carries forward across every commit. A superfile with no
//! postings in any segment is uncovered and is probed directly.
//!
//! **Content addressing.** Root and slices are named by the blake3 of their
//! bytes (`term-index/root-<hash>.bin`, `term-index/slice-<hash>.bin`), so a
//! write is idempotent, a manifest pins an exact version, and GC keeps every
//! object a manifest inside the safety gap still names.
