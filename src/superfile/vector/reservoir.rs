//! Reservoir sampling for k-means training in the streaming
//! `VectorBuilder`.
//!
//! The build path is k-means-bound, not corpus-bound — the
//! information k-means needs to converge is a representative
//! sample of the corpus, not every vector. Drawing a bounded
//! uniform-random sample (typically `64 × n_cent`, capped at
//! 500 K vectors) and training on that produces centroids that
//! are recall-indistinguishable from training on the full
//! corpus, while making memory consumption a function of
//! `(n_cent, dim)` rather than `(n_docs, dim)`.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! Vitter Algorithm L (1985, "Random Sampling with a Reservoir"):
//! O(k(1 + log(n/k))) total work, O(log n) amortized per
//! `update` call once the reservoir is full. Algorithm L wins
//! over Algorithm R (O(1) per add but n Bernoulli draws) at
//! large n/k ratios — at 10M docs with k=100K, the per-call
//! work is ~7× less.
//!
//! Sketch:
//!
//! 1. Fill the reservoir with the first `k` items.
//! 2. Compute `W = U^(1/k)` where `U ~ Uniform(0, 1)`.
//! 3. Compute a skip distance `S = floor(ln(U') / ln(1 − W))`;
//!    that many items pass without touching the reservoir.
//! 4. Replace a uniformly random slot with the item at index
//!    `i + S + 1`.
//! 5. Update `W = W × U''^(1/k)`. Repeat from (3).
//!
//! The replacement slot is uniform over `[0, k)`; the skip
//! distance follows a geometric distribution whose mean grows
//! as the stream advances, which is exactly what makes the
//! per-item amortized cost drop to O(log n).
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Seeded from a caller-supplied `u64` so identical builds
//! produce identical reservoirs (and therefore identical
//! centroids, since k-means itself is deterministic given
//! initialization). `StdRng` rather than `ChaCha8Rng` — both
//! are seedable + deterministic + reproducible across `rand`
//! patch versions, and `StdRng` is already a transitive dep
//! via `rand 0.10` so we avoid pulling in `rand_chacha`.
